## 🎯 Common Questions

**Q: What if they don't respond?**
A: You've done something thoughtful. Be proud of that, regardless of the outcome.

**Q: Can they see who sent it?**
A: Only if you tell them! The website itself says "From someone who still thinks about you"

**Q: Will it work on their phone?**
A: Yes! It's fully responsive and tested on mobile devices.

**Q: Does it need internet?**
A: Once the page loads, everything works offline (except the initial load).

**Q: Can I see if they visited?**
A: Not with this basic setup. GitHub Pages doesn't provide visitor analytics by default.

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**Site not loading?**
- Wait 2-3 minutes after enabling Pages
- Check that you selected the correct branch
- Try the URL in incognito mode

**Animations not working?**
- Make sure JavaScript is enabled in the browser
- Try a different browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari all work)

**Music not playing?**
- Make sure sound is on
- Some browsers require user interaction (click the button)
- Volume might be low - check device volume

## 💙 Final Thoughts

You're taking a brave step to reconnect. Whatever happens, you're putting yourself out there with honesty and care. That takes courage.

The website shows:

- You care enough to make an effort  
- You're willing to take the first step
- You're creative and thoughtful

These are all good things. Now take a deep breath, click deploy, and let the universe handle the rest.
